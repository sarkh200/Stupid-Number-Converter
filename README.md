Converts base 10 numbers into other stupid number systems.

# Rules for current number systems:
## Booga Numerals
### Rules:
* The number of "booga"s should correspond to the number of zeros needed to denote a place value. (Ex: 100 would result in two "booga"s, and 1 would not require any "booga"s) 
* The number of "ooga"s should correspond to the number in a specific place value (Ex: 900 would result in nine "ooga"s)
* Each place value should be seperated with the appropriate number of "booga"s (Ex: 201 would be ooga ooga booga booga ooga)
### Examples:
* 100: ooga booga booga
* 101: ooga booga booga ooga
* 281: ooga ooga booga booga ooga ooga ooga ooga ooga ooga ooga ooga booga ooga
* -10: booga ooga booga

## Base Booga
Binary, but uses "ooga" for 1 and "booga" for 0. Negative numbers are denoted though a number starting with "booga."
